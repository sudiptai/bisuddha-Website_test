          <span className='h5 bw uc'>Environment: </span>
          The environment is our priority. Keeping in mind environmental sustainability makes us think about producing every product eco-friendly. We are proud to declare that the product ingredients mainly belong to fruits. Amla, Indian Gooseberry, and Imli, better known as Tamarind, are widely used to make our sustainable products. Benefits of guava, mango and custard apple are also given through procurement of products in the Indian society. We hope our new innovative food products will ensure people's physical well-being and contribute to environmental sustainability.
